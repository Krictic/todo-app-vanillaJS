# todo-app-vanillaJS
Project made as an exercise for me to learn DOM manipulation with vanilla JS.

Note that not everything is functional as of now, particularly the increase and decrease priority buttons are unfinished and the delete button does not work as intended yet.

Todo:
1. Fix the delte task button.
2. Finish implementing the priority buttons.
3. Make page update the list when changing priority values.
4. Fix the task card CSS.
