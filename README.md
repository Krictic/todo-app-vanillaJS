Note that not everything is functional as of now, particularly the increase and decrease priority buttons are unfinished and the delete button does not work as intended yet.

Todo:

1. Fix the delte task button.
2. Finish implementing the priority buttons.
3. Make page update the list when changing priority values.
4. Fix the task card CSS.
